The only downside is the district zones your kids far away from their neighborhood. Our apartment is zoned for a school 13 minutes away, even though there is a school walking distance away. It has caused a lot of suffering actually. I ended up getting plantar fasciitis from driving so much, and so my daughter had to catch the bus. On Friday she got punched on the bus. So now I don't know what I'm going to do. The bus is awful. Kids climb under the chairs and punch other kids on the butt and steal their stuff. It is just a nightmare, not to mention the driver can't pay attention to the road because the kids are all playing their recorders, fighting, and screaming. It is so dangerous, and the fumes are just awful from the old, old buses too. It is ridiculous to zone kids away from their house. Causes so much inconvenience to parents, and so much pollution and traffic with thousands of parents driving around. I chose Chapel Hill over Cary because I'd read that Cary buses kids out of their neighborhood, but it turns out that Chapel Hill is the same.\",\n",

Their experience has varied mostly based on the teacher(s) they\\'ve had from year to year. In general, the teachers have been very good. I\\'ll agree that the assessment process for above average children is slow but I\\'m OK with this as I want my kids to focus on excelling in high school and college, not elementary school. I just don\\'t think it\\'s particularly important to put kids into a \"bright\" program in the first, second or third grades.',\n",

It does seem to be all about test scores and when teachers do creative and fun things they seem to get pinched by the administration. The administration is very weak and distant. They seem to have almost no people skills and from the staff members I've talked to, morale is at an all time low. It's such a shame because I think we have some really strong teachers and parents.\",\n",

On International Night, 40 countries are represented. My kids have teachers from Ecuador, France, Kuwait, and Germany. The community is both diverse and integrated, which is rare. Extracurriculars are great: beautiful art, pottery, and music studios, a nature preserve, and afterschool classes (Indian and salsa dancing, soccer, art). After touring other private schools, I m surprised that MCS doesn t have a higher profile. From pre-k through 5th grade, I consider it the best in the area.',\n",

       "      'review': \"This is a great school and we are so happy to have found it. The public schools in Chapel Hill have a decent reputation, but I wanted more for my kids. We definitely got what we were looking for! My child is in the upper elementary program now and started in the toddler program. My child is engaged and is enthusiastic about learning inside and outside the classroom. What is nice is that other parents from different schools notice that MCS kids stand out - they ask thoughtful, intelligent questions, they are independent, resourceful, kind, polite, and are natural leaders in group situations. It's a wonderful community of engaged parents and faculty. There are many social events to get to know other parents and children. My child has made some great friends that will last a lifetime. The campus is huge - the view from the street is not the entire school! I would encourage you to take a tour and learn more about all there is here. There is a new Science Lab, an Art Room with a Clay Studio, a Music classroom, sport field, sand volleyball, and many play ground areas.\",\n",

       "      'review': \"I have two sons currently in their second year at Montessori Community School-- one in the Adolescent Community and one in Upper Elementary. We chose this school after becoming unhappy with the limitations of nearby Cary, NC (Wake County) public schools, which seemed to be focusing more and more on test scores and less and less on fostering an environment where children would be consistently treated with respect and kindness. I'm sure budget cuts related to the economic downturn played a large part (high test scores = more funding), but my kids were really beginning to struggle in a system that stifled their individuality. Enrolling in MCS has been hands down the absolute right thing for our family. I can't say enough about what a wonderful community it is! Teachers are interesting, dynamic, enthusiastic, and sincere. The Head of School is fantastic-- intelligent, dedicated, caring, engaged, and clearly excited about and proud of her school. And my kids are thrilled to be having more choices and taking a more active part in their own learning and development. I'd give this school more than 5 stars if I could! Highly recommended.\",\n",

       "      'review': \"Read this review with the knowledge 1) I am an Asian and we want our kids to do excellent in academics. 2) This is critique of Montessori System in general Montessori system was developed in east Europe 100 years ago where most people would learn a vocation by the age of 15 or so - and do that for life. Now, we all study up to age 21 or so without much specialization, and then decide on specialization. What worked 100 years back may not work today. The specific criticism is that: 1) Most kids is public school can read by KG, not in MCS. The reason being - let the kid choose what he wants to do. If your kid is lazy, he won't learn to read - irrespective of how bright he is. 2) MCS kids come from highly educated families - as it is a private school. However, the performance of kids in standardized tests is just average till grade 3. Again blame it on Montessorie - kids are not forced to learn hence they don't learn. 3) The staff and teachers at MCS are pleasant - and your kid would like it here because they get 2 hours of play plus 30 min lunch each day. I don't know of any case of bullying.\",\n",

The principal does not answer emails or respond to parents. She believes that \"they\" know what they are doing \"Just let us do the teaching. If you are interested in your child doing well on a test , then this is the place for you. If you are interested in you child\\'s well being, find some place else because good test scores are all you will receive. If you child is diverse but doesn\\'t speak English as a second language, take a look at the disparity in the test scores for minorities. No recess is required at this school. In kindergarten they get 20min of recess in an 8 hour day and 20min eat lunch. When you speak to other parents about your concerns, all you get is one of their battle stories.

The technology in the school is impressive. My daughter's class told a story about snowmen using I-pads. I like the way they reward children with special activities instead of with food. They are very active in their antibullying campaigns and the security seems top notch (after school security is a little questionable.) Overall, we've been VERY impressed with Ephesus and can't complain a bit! Highly recommend!\",\n",

The teachers know your child very well and they are dedicated to helping him/her grow intellectually, morally, and socially. We really feel grateful to have such gifted adults focusing on our kids. MCS emphasizes \"grace and courtesy.\" Children develop good old-fashioned manners, and good personal habits like putting away toys. In all of our time on the playground, there has never been an incident. Bullying doesn t exist. As practiced here, the Montessori method fosters creativity and independent inquiry kids learn for fun. On International Night, 40 countries are represented. My kids have teachers from Ecuador, France, Kuwait, and Germany. The community is both diverse and integrated, which is rare. Extracurriculars are great: beautiful art, pottery, and music studios, a nature preserve, and afterschool classes (Indian and salsa dancing, soccer, art). After touring other private schools, I m surprised that MCS doesn t have a higher profile. From pre-k through 5th grade, I consider it the best in the area.',\n",

We definitely got what we were looking for! My child is in the upper elementary program now and started in the toddler program. My child is engaged and is enthusiastic about learning inside and outside the classroom. What is nice is that other parents from different schools notice that MCS kids stand out - they ask thoughtful, intelligent questions, they are independent, resourceful, kind, polite, and are natural leaders in group situations. It's a wonderful community of engaged parents and faculty. There are many social events to get to know other parents and children. My child has made some great friends that will last a lifetime. The campus is huge - the view from the street is not the entire school! I would encourage you to take a tour and learn more about all there is here. There is a new Science Lab, an Art Room with a Clay Studio, a Music classroom, sport field, sand volleyball, and many play ground areas.\",\n",

We chose this school after becoming unhappy with the limitations of nearby Cary, NC (Wake County) public schools, which seemed to be focusing more and more on test scores and less and less on fostering an environment where children would be consistently treated with respect and kindness. I'm sure budget cuts related to the economic downturn played a large part (high test scores = more funding), but my kids were really beginning to struggle in a system that stifled their individuality. Enrolling in MCS has been hands down the absolute right thing for our family. I can't say enough about what a wonderful community it is! Teachers are interesting, dynamic, enthusiastic, and sincere. The Head of School is fantastic-- intelligent, dedicated, caring, engaged, and clearly excited about and proud of her school. And my kids are thrilled to be having more choices and taking a more active part in their own learning and development. I'd give this school more than 5 stars if I could! Highly recommended.\",\n",

Now, we all study up to age 21 or so without much specialization, and then decide on specialization. What worked 100 years back may not work today. The specific criticism is that: 1) Most kids is public school can read by KG, not in MCS. The reason being - let the kid choose what he wants to do. If your kid is lazy, he won't learn to read - irrespective of how bright he is. 2) MCS kids come from highly educated families - as it is a private school. However, the performance of kids in standardized tests is just average till grade 3. Again blame it on Montessorie - kids are not forced to learn hence they don't learn. 3) The staff and teachers at MCS are pleasant - and your kid would like it here because they get 2 hours of play plus 30 min lunch each day. I don't know of any case of bullying.\",\n",

This year, he has faced some health concerns and has missed quite a few days of school. The Middle School teachers have worked beautifully with us as a family to work together as a team to ensure that our child has a successful school year. They have met with us at 2 conferences--multiple teachers at a time, sent email updates and worked with us to make sure he gets a great education in spite of missing days at school. On top of that, the love, concern and prayers he receives from his friends just makes us know that St. Thomas More school is the right place for our child and our family. Our son has good friends at the school who care about him. We've been a family at this school for 11 years.

I am desperately seeking another school, but alas have been wait listed at all area quality schools. We so dread returning here , and are seriously considering using the public school system until the wait lists open up.',\n",

After reading their experiences my mind immediately went to the board announcing where seniors were to attend university in the fall. During my time, each year, motivation and intimidation came from the names of the familiar next to the likes of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and believe it or not UNC. At the time I had more than one friend denied from UNC and attended one of the aforementioned schools. from my class many students became MDs, PhD‘s and a few professional athletes. Before my time a former CEO of Hewlett Packard was a falcon. From my understanding she did not enjoy her It so it appears she turned out OK. I fell somewhere in the middle completing a masters degree.',\n",

       "      'review': \"East is the most challenging public high school in the state. The stress level is unbelievable and most people say they put forth more effort here than they ever had to in college. If you don't take honors and AP classes, then you are looked down upon by peers, teachers and the administration. Very rarely do students take more then 1 standard class a year. It is very uncommon for a student to graduate with less then 5 AP credits. The rigor is unbelievable and most students are up all hours of the nigh doing work. Teachers are excellent and are reachable almost all hours of the day and night. If you aren't willing to put forth the effort of a rigorous college student, then this is not the school for you. As for the social aspect, Chapel Hill is a primarily wealthy town college town. So the preppy attitude is expected. With that the party atmosphere is not small. The school is very safe with 1 police officer, 3 security guards, and a key card system. If you want to put forth the effort, and used to the demanding social and educational atmosphere, then east is a great school for you.\",\n",

Test scores may be as good as ever but the principal and counselors are terrible. Getting the principal to return a call, let alone set up a face t o face meeting is nearly impossible. The athletic director plays favorites among teams. He let the high profile football (who quit after 2 years) devastate some of the other teams such as wrestling because the football coach bullied the kids into playing ONLY football. My son's counselor doesn't seem to care and gets very defensive when you ask questions. My older son a true relationship with his counselor. She checked in with him. Knew what he was involved in and was a great asset during junior in preparing for college. My current son's counselor will write him a college recommendation without even even knowing him. On a positive note - their are some outstanding dedicated teachers and my son has been lucky enough to have a few of these. The ones that not only share their knowledge but instill passion for curiosity.\",\n",

I firmly believe (and there are scientific studies that back up) that exercise is truly the best medicine for ADHD. Githens not only has required P.E. for every grade level but the have frequent physical activity days. This innovative system is when a rotating schedule of one designated class in the day's schedule will take the kids somewhere for physical activity. No hiding on phones, moving the entire period. There are 19 (yes 19) sports teams at Githens, more than any other middle school in the district. They have an incredible band program lead by the very talented and devoted Mr Blackburn. They still have art and drama and multiple music classes.Principal Williams leads an impressive, caring staff. Cant wait for my daughter to attend next year.\",\n",

Both students enjoyed going to school each day (as much as middle schoolers do), felt safe and most definitely felt a part of a vibrant community. The student population at Githens is very diverse, both culturally, economically and academically. While this level of diversity can present challenges, the staff and students see it as one of the strengths of the school and embrace it. Teachers and administrators work diligently to give each child what s/he needs to succeed in the world beyond Githens, and they hold each child to a high standard of behavior. My (current) high schooler left Githens prepared for the academic challenges of high school, and my eighth grader will do the same. They've enjoyed meeting new friends, participating in the strong music program and have both had a chance to take up new sports while in middle school.Test scores cannot and do not accurately reflect what goes on in the classrooms of this school, and yet, so much of the Great Schools score is dependent on them. I would urge anyone considering Githens to walk through the doors and see what goes on each day.\",\n",

This innovative system is when a rotating schedule of one designated class in the day's schedule will take the kids somewhere for physical activity. No hiding on phones, moving the entire period. There are 19 (yes 19) sports teams at Githens, more than any other middle school in the district. They have an incredible band program lead by the very talented and devoted Mr Blackburn.

       "      'review': \"I have had two children attend Githens. Both students enjoyed going to school each day (as much as middle schoolers do), felt safe and most definitely felt a part of a vibrant community. The student population at Githens is very diverse, both culturally, economically and academically. While this level of diversity can present challenges, the staff and students see it as one of the strengths of the school and embrace it. Teachers and administrators work diligently to give each child what s/he needs to succeed in the world beyond Githens, and they hold each child to a high standard of behavior. My (current) high schooler left Githens prepared for the academic challenges of high school, and my eighth grader will do the same. They've enjoyed meeting new friends, participating in the strong music program and have both had a chance to take up new sports while in middle school.Test scores cannot and do not accurately reflect what goes on in the classrooms of this school, and yet, so much of the Great Schools score is dependent on them. I would urge anyone considering Githens to walk through the doors and see what goes on each day.\",\n",

After reading their experiences my mind immediately went to the board announcing where seniors were to attend university in the fall. During my time, each year, motivation and intimidation came from the names of the familiar next to the likes of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and believe it or not UNC. At the time I had more than one friend denied from UNC and attended one of the aforementioned schools. from my class many students became MDs, PhD‘s and a few professional athletes. Before my time a former CEO of Hewlett Packard was a falcon. From my understanding she did not enjoy her It so it appears she turned out OK.
