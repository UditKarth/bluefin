The only downside is the district zones your kids far away from their neighborhood. Our apartment is zoned for a school 13 minutes away, even though there is a school walking distance away. It has caused a lot of suffering actually. I ended up getting plantar fasciitis from driving so much, and so my daughter had to catch the bus. On Friday she got punched on the bus. So now I don't know what I'm going to do. The bus is awful. Kids climb under the chairs and punch other kids on the butt and steal their stuff. It is just a nightmare, not to mention the driver can't pay attention to the road because the kids are all playing their recorders, fighting, and screaming. It is so dangerous, and the fumes are just awful from the old, old buses too. It is ridiculous to zone kids away from their house. Causes so much inconvenience to parents, and so much pollution and traffic with thousands of parents driving around. I chose Chapel Hill over Cary because I'd read that Cary buses kids out of their neighborhood, but it turns out that Chapel Hill is the same.\",\n",

Their experience has varied mostly based on the teacher(s) they\\'ve had from year to year. In general, the teachers have been very good. I\\'ll agree that the assessment process for above average children is slow but I\\'m OK with this as I want my kids to focus on excelling in high school and college, not elementary school. I just don\\'t think it\\'s particularly important to put kids into a \"bright\" program in the first, second or third grades.',\n",

It does seem to be all about test scores and when teachers do creative and fun things they seem to get pinched by the administration. The administration is very weak and distant. They seem to have almost no people skills and from the staff members I've talked to, morale is at an all time low. It's such a shame because I think we have some really strong teachers and parents.\",\n",

MCS emphasizes \"grace and courtesy.\" Children develop good old-fashioned manners, and good personal habits like putting away toys. In all of our time on the playground, there has never been an incident. Bullying doesn t exist. As practiced here, the Montessori method fosters creativity and independent inquiry kids learn for fun. On International Night, 40 countries are represented. My kids have teachers from Ecuador, France, Kuwait, and Germany. The community is both diverse and integrated, which is rare. Extracurriculars are great: beautiful art, pottery, and music studios, a nature preserve, and afterschool classes (Indian and salsa dancing, soccer, art).

       "      'review': \"This is a great school and we are so happy to have found it. The public schools in Chapel Hill have a decent reputation, but I wanted more for my kids. We definitely got what we were looking for! My child is in the upper elementary program now and started in the toddler program. My child is engaged and is enthusiastic about learning inside and outside the classroom. What is nice is that other parents from different schools notice that MCS kids stand out - they ask thoughtful, intelligent questions, they are independent, resourceful, kind, polite, and are natural leaders in group situations. It's a wonderful community of engaged parents and faculty. There are many social events to get to know other parents and children. My child has made some great friends that will last a lifetime. The campus is huge - the view from the street is not the entire school! I would encourage you to take a tour and learn more about all there is here. There is a new Science Lab, an Art Room with a Clay Studio, a Music classroom, sport field, sand volleyball, and many play ground areas.\",\n",

       "      'review': \"I have two sons currently in their second year at Montessori Community School-- one in the Adolescent Community and one in Upper Elementary. We chose this school after becoming unhappy with the limitations of nearby Cary, NC (Wake County) public schools, which seemed to be focusing more and more on test scores and less and less on fostering an environment where children would be consistently treated with respect and kindness. I'm sure budget cuts related to the economic downturn played a large part (high test scores = more funding), but my kids were really beginning to struggle in a system that stifled their individuality. Enrolling in MCS has been hands down the absolute right thing for our family. I can't say enough about what a wonderful community it is! Teachers are interesting, dynamic, enthusiastic, and sincere. The Head of School is fantastic-- intelligent, dedicated, caring, engaged, and clearly excited about and proud of her school. And my kids are thrilled to be having more choices and taking a more active part in their own learning and development. I'd give this school more than 5 stars if I could! Highly recommended.\",\n",

       "      'review': \"Read this review with the knowledge 1) I am an Asian and we want our kids to do excellent in academics. 2) This is critique of Montessori System in general Montessori system was developed in east Europe 100 years ago where most people would learn a vocation by the age of 15 or so - and do that for life. Now, we all study up to age 21 or so without much specialization, and then decide on specialization. What worked 100 years back may not work today. The specific criticism is that: 1) Most kids is public school can read by KG, not in MCS. The reason being - let the kid choose what he wants to do. If your kid is lazy, he won't learn to read - irrespective of how bright he is. 2) MCS kids come from highly educated families - as it is a private school. However, the performance of kids in standardized tests is just average till grade 3. Again blame it on Montessorie - kids are not forced to learn hence they don't learn. 3) The staff and teachers at MCS are pleasant - and your kid would like it here because they get 2 hours of play plus 30 min lunch each day. I don't know of any case of bullying.\",\n",

The teachers are stressed out and over-reactive and defensive if a parent asks a question. They do not communicate with parents unless they have to and then it is usually with a post-it. The principal does not answer emails or respond to parents. She believes that \"they\" know what they are doing \"Just let us do the teaching. If you are interested in your child doing well on a test , then this is the place for you. If you are interested in you child\\'s well being, find some place else because good test scores are all you will receive. If you child is diverse but doesn\\'t speak English as a second language, take a look at the disparity in the test scores for minorities. No recess is required at this school. In kindergarten they get 20min of recess in an 8 hour day and 20min eat lunch. When you speak to other parents about your concerns, all you get is one of their battle stories. Not once have a heard a parent say, This is a good school. It\\'s always, \"Yeah, we\\'re frustrated too!\"',\n",

The technology in the school is impressive. My daughter's class told a story about snowmen using I-pads. I like the way they reward children with special activities instead of with food. They are very active in their antibullying campaigns and the security seems top notch (after school security is a little questionable.)

The teachers know your child very well and they are dedicated to helping him/her grow intellectually, morally, and socially. We really feel grateful to have such gifted adults focusing on our kids. MCS emphasizes \"grace and courtesy.\" Children develop good old-fashioned manners, and good personal habits like putting away toys. In all of our time on the playground, there has never been an incident. Bullying doesn t exist. As practiced here, the Montessori method fosters creativity and independent inquiry kids learn for fun. On International Night, 40 countries are represented. My kids have teachers from Ecuador, France, Kuwait, and Germany. The community is both diverse and integrated, which is rare. Extracurriculars are great: beautiful art, pottery, and music studios, a nature preserve, and afterschool classes (Indian and salsa dancing, soccer, art). After touring other private schools, I m surprised that MCS doesn t have a higher profile. From pre-k through 5th grade, I consider it the best in the area.',\n",

We definitely got what we were looking for! My child is in the upper elementary program now and started in the toddler program. My child is engaged and is enthusiastic about learning inside and outside the classroom. What is nice is that other parents from different schools notice that MCS kids stand out - they ask thoughtful, intelligent questions, they are independent, resourceful, kind, polite, and are natural leaders in group situations. It's a wonderful community of engaged parents and faculty. There are many social events to get to know other parents and children. My child has made some great friends that will last a lifetime. The campus is huge - the view from the street is not the entire school! I would encourage you to take a tour and learn more about all there is here. There is a new Science Lab, an Art Room with a Clay Studio, a Music classroom, sport field, sand volleyball, and many play ground areas.\",\n",

We chose this school after becoming unhappy with the limitations of nearby Cary, NC (Wake County) public schools, which seemed to be focusing more and more on test scores and less and less on fostering an environment where children would be consistently treated with respect and kindness. I'm sure budget cuts related to the economic downturn played a large part (high test scores = more funding), but my kids were really beginning to struggle in a system that stifled their individuality. Enrolling in MCS has been hands down the absolute right thing for our family. I can't say enough about what a wonderful community it is! Teachers are interesting, dynamic, enthusiastic, and sincere. The Head of School is fantastic-- intelligent, dedicated, caring, engaged, and clearly excited about and proud of her school. And my kids are thrilled to be having more choices and taking a more active part in their own learning and development. I'd give this school more than 5 stars if I could! Highly recommended.\",\n",

       "      'review': \"Read this review with the knowledge 1) I am an Asian and we want our kids to do excellent in academics. 2) This is critique of Montessori System in general Montessori system was developed in east Europe 100 years ago where most people would learn a vocation by the age of 15 or so - and do that for life. Now, we all study up to age 21 or so without much specialization, and then decide on specialization. What worked 100 years back may not work today. The specific criticism is that: 1) Most kids is public school can read by KG, not in MCS. The reason being - let the kid choose what he wants to do. If your kid is lazy, he won't learn to read - irrespective of how bright he is. 2) MCS kids come from highly educated families - as it is a private school. However, the performance of kids in standardized tests is just average till grade 3. Again blame it on Montessorie - kids are not forced to learn hence they don't learn. 3) The staff and teachers at MCS are pleasant - and your kid would like it here because they get 2 hours of play plus 30 min lunch each day. I don't know of any case of bullying.\",\n",

This year, he has faced some health concerns and has missed quite a few days of school. The Middle School teachers have worked beautifully with us as a family to work together as a team to ensure that our child has a successful school year. They have met with us at 2 conferences--multiple teachers at a time, sent email updates and worked with us to make sure he gets a great education in spite of missing days at school. On top of that, the love, concern and prayers he receives from his friends just makes us know that St. Thomas More school is the right place for our child and our family. Our son has good friends at the school who care about him. We've been a family at this school for 11 years.

When asked anything substantive specific to Catholic Education..they give the reference to what is done at the PUBLIC schools!!???.I have since learned that they are both from the PUBLIC school system. We have been here 3 years and have been SHOCKED at the children\\'s behavior that we see , and how it has negatively influenced my child\\'s behavior. I am desperately seeking another school, but alas have been wait listed at all area quality schools. We so dread returning here , and are seriously considering using the public school system until the wait lists open up.',\n",

After reading their experiences my mind immediately went to the board announcing where seniors were to attend university in the fall. During my time, each year, motivation and intimidation came from the names of the familiar next to the likes of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and believe it or not UNC. At the time I had more than one friend denied from UNC and attended one of the aforementioned schools. from my class many students became MDs, PhD‘s and a few professional athletes. Before my time a former CEO of Hewlett Packard was a falcon. From my understanding she did not enjoy her It so it appears she turned out OK.

       "      'review': \"If you have a student without special needs of any kind...this is a good school in comparison to some others. In four years I have been battling this school with 3 principals (soon to be 4), countless LEA and uncooperative administration. In four years and three children....there have been three different needs but the same struggle year after year. Every year we meet the first month of school. By Holiday time....everyone makes plans for what to do when students return. By time the teacher, ec staff and I are on the same page its the end of the year. We have the same exact fight every single year. At this school I have received a (EC) Parent Handbook from 2008 but was updated 2009. Last week after me asking repetitively I have finally received a 2016 handbook. I had a son with a 504 plan. The teachers wouldn't even return emails. Emails are always a problem but at least its a paper trail. I had a son be bullied last year. There was less than 10 students 2 teachers in the classroom and no one did anything until my son decided he had had enough. I had a teacher become confrontational in front of students and wouldn't even listen to my freshmans special needs. I have asked the PTA, Principal, staff and more if there is a EC representative in the PTA. No one will answer. Our needs are very different. Most of us have worries that no one would understand. Most regular parents have no idea what a IEP is. Most parents are able to go to work and not worry about their children. Most parent don't have concerns about a contained classroom or inclusion. They don't worry about ESY. They don't worry about records and placement. Football, solar panels, track nor any other organization deals with our issues. Students are clueless because there is more disabilities than mental retardation even though that's the term used no matter what the disability. This is hands down a great school in comparison to others but that's just for the quote unquote normal student. As I look through the website every year....WHERE ARE WE REPRESENTED? I appreciate they want to be confidential but student will continue to not include everyone if the adults won't. Every single year I have to start due process. Every single year. Changing principals with the same bitter staff is worthless. Now there has been two teachers that were great. NOT EC EITHER. SHAME ON THEM.\",\n",

The stress level is unbelievable and most people say they put forth more effort here than they ever had to in college. If you don't take honors and AP classes, then you are looked down upon by peers, teachers and the administration. Very rarely do students take more then 1 standard class a year. It is very uncommon for a student to graduate with less then 5 AP credits. The rigor is unbelievable and most students are up all hours of the nigh doing work. Teachers are excellent and are reachable almost all hours of the day and night. If you aren't willing to put forth the effort of a rigorous college student, then this is not the school for you. As for the social aspect, Chapel Hill is a primarily wealthy town college town. So the preppy attitude is expected. With that the party atmosphere is not small. The school is very safe with 1 police officer, 3 security guards, and a key card system. If you want to put forth the effort, and used to the demanding social and educational atmosphere, then east is a great school for you.\",\n",

Test scores may be as good as ever but the principal and counselors are terrible. Getting the principal to return a call, let alone set up a face t o face meeting is nearly impossible. The athletic director plays favorites among teams. He let the high profile football (who quit after 2 years) devastate some of the other teams such as wrestling because the football coach bullied the kids into playing ONLY football. My son's counselor doesn't seem to care and gets very defensive when you ask questions. My older son a true relationship with his counselor. She checked in with him. Knew what he was involved in and was a great asset during junior in preparing for college. My current son's counselor will write him a college recommendation without even even knowing him. On a positive note - their are some outstanding dedicated teachers and my son has been lucky enough to have a few of these. The ones that not only share their knowledge but instill passion for curiosity.\",\n",

I firmly believe (and there are scientific studies that back up) that exercise is truly the best medicine for ADHD. Githens not only has required P.E. for every grade level but the have frequent physical activity days. This innovative system is when a rotating schedule of one designated class in the day's schedule will take the kids somewhere for physical activity. No hiding on phones, moving the entire period. There are 19 (yes 19) sports teams at Githens, more than any other middle school in the district. They have an incredible band program lead by the very talented and devoted Mr Blackburn. They still have art and drama and multiple music classes.Principal Williams leads an impressive, caring staff. Cant wait for my daughter to attend next year.\",\n",

Both students enjoyed going to school each day (as much as middle schoolers do), felt safe and most definitely felt a part of a vibrant community. The student population at Githens is very diverse, both culturally, economically and academically. While this level of diversity can present challenges, the staff and students see it as one of the strengths of the school and embrace it. Teachers and administrators work diligently to give each child what s/he needs to succeed in the world beyond Githens, and they hold each child to a high standard of behavior. My (current) high schooler left Githens prepared for the academic challenges of high school, and my eighth grader will do the same. They've enjoyed meeting new friends, participating in the strong music program and have both had a chance to take up new sports while in middle school.Test scores cannot and do not accurately reflect what goes on in the classrooms of this school, and yet, so much of the Great Schools score is dependent on them. I would urge anyone considering Githens to walk through the doors and see what goes on each day.\",\n",

       "      'review': \"If you have a student without special needs of any kind...this is a good school in comparison to some others. In four years I have been battling this school with 3 principals (soon to be 4), countless LEA and uncooperative administration. In four years and three children....there have been three different needs but the same struggle year after year. Every year we meet the first month of school. By Holiday time....everyone makes plans for what to do when students return. By time the teacher, ec staff and I are on the same page its the end of the year. We have the same exact fight every single year. At this school I have received a (EC) Parent Handbook from 2008 but was updated 2009. Last week after me asking repetitively I have finally received a 2016 handbook. I had a son with a 504 plan. The teachers wouldn't even return emails. Emails are always a problem but at least its a paper trail. I had a son be bullied last year. There was less than 10 students 2 teachers in the classroom and no one did anything until my son decided he had had enough. I had a teacher become confrontational in front of students and wouldn't even listen to my freshmans special needs. I have asked the PTA, Principal, staff and more if there is a EC representative in the PTA. No one will answer. Our needs are very different. Most of us have worries that no one would understand. Most regular parents have no idea what a IEP is. Most parents are able to go to work and not worry about their children. Most parent don't have concerns about a contained classroom or inclusion. They don't worry about ESY. They don't worry about records and placement. Football, solar panels, track nor any other organization deals with our issues. Students are clueless because there is more disabilities than mental retardation even though that's the term used no matter what the disability. This is hands down a great school in comparison to others but that's just for the quote unquote normal student. As I look through the website every year....WHERE ARE WE REPRESENTED? I appreciate they want to be confidential but student will continue to not include everyone if the adults won't. Every single year I have to start due process. Every single year. Changing principals with the same bitter staff is worthless. Now there has been two teachers that were great. NOT EC EITHER. SHAME ON THEM.\",\n",

She doesn't get into trouble but yet is being harassed.\",\n",

       "      'review': \"We have a rising 8th grader with ADHD. The teachers and staff work with parents to make sure every student has the opportunity to succeed. I firmly believe (and there are scientific studies that back up) that exercise is truly the best medicine for ADHD. Githens not only has required P.E. for every grade level but the have frequent physical activity days. This innovative system is when a rotating schedule of one designated class in the day's schedule will take the kids somewhere for physical activity. No hiding on phones, moving the entire period. There are 19 (yes 19) sports teams at Githens, more than any other middle school in the district. They have an incredible band program lead by the very talented and devoted Mr Blackburn. They still have art and drama and multiple music classes.Principal Williams leads an impressive, caring staff. Cant wait for my daughter to attend next year.\",\n",

       "      'review': \"I have had two children attend Githens. Both students enjoyed going to school each day (as much as middle schoolers do), felt safe and most definitely felt a part of a vibrant community. The student population at Githens is very diverse, both culturally, economically and academically. While this level of diversity can present challenges, the staff and students see it as one of the strengths of the school and embrace it. Teachers and administrators work diligently to give each child what s/he needs to succeed in the world beyond Githens, and they hold each child to a high standard of behavior. My (current) high schooler left Githens prepared for the academic challenges of high school, and my eighth grader will do the same. They've enjoyed meeting new friends, participating in the strong music program and have both had a chance to take up new sports while in middle school.Test scores cannot and do not accurately reflect what goes on in the classrooms of this school, and yet, so much of the Great Schools score is dependent on them. I would urge anyone considering Githens to walk through the doors and see what goes on each day.\",\n",

At the time I had more than one friend denied from UNC and attended one of the aforementioned schools. from my class many students became MDs, PhD‘s and a few professional athletes.

       "      'review': \"If you have a student without special needs of any kind...this is a good school in comparison to some others. In four years I have been battling this school with 3 principals (soon to be 4), countless LEA and uncooperative administration. In four years and three children....there have been three different needs but the same struggle year after year. Every year we meet the first month of school. By Holiday time....everyone makes plans for what to do when students return. By time the teacher, ec staff and I are on the same page its the end of the year. We have the same exact fight every single year. At this school I have received a (EC) Parent Handbook from 2008 but was updated 2009. Last week after me asking repetitively I have finally received a 2016 handbook. I had a son with a 504 plan. The teachers wouldn't even return emails. Emails are always a problem but at least its a paper trail. I had a son be bullied last year. There was less than 10 students 2 teachers in the classroom and no one did anything until my son decided he had had enough. I had a teacher become confrontational in front of students and wouldn't even listen to my freshmans special needs. I have asked the PTA, Principal, staff and more if there is a EC representative in the PTA. No one will answer. Our needs are very different. Most of us have worries that no one would understand. Most regular parents have no idea what a IEP is. Most parents are able to go to work and not worry about their children. Most parent don't have concerns about a contained classroom or inclusion. They don't worry about ESY. They don't worry about records and placement. Football, solar panels, track nor any other organization deals with our issues. Students are clueless because there is more disabilities than mental retardation even though that's the term used no matter what the disability. This is hands down a great school in comparison to others but that's just for the quote unquote normal student. As I look through the website every year....WHERE ARE WE REPRESENTED? I appreciate they want to be confidential but student will continue to not include everyone if the adults won't. Every single year I have to start due process. Every single year. Changing principals with the same bitter staff is worthless. Now there has been two teachers that were great. NOT EC EITHER. SHAME ON THEM.\",\n",

Ms. Carol the schools administrator is so involved and I can tell has a true passion for her work. This school is not stuck up judgemental or snobby. I felt very comfortable trusting them with my son. I will have him enrolled next year for primary as well. Very pleased.\",\n",

She ensures the school is a loving, safe environment that definitely promotes learning. I am amazed at what my kids have learned. My daughter did 2 yrs preschool and just finished her K year, all with Ms. Maria. My son did 1 yr in the toddler rm and 2 yrs with Ms.Sally in preschool. The two teachers have entirely different personalities, but both were GOOD teachers & a GREAT fit for my kids. Ms. Dora in the aftercare rm was so patient with the kids. She's the kind of person all working parents would want their kids with. She kept the rm running like an extension of the preschool with a relaxed, fun atmosphere. I am heartbroken that the school no longer goes beyond the K grade as I would have loved for my son to stay there to get the same K my daughter got. The location is great if you live in East....but I know one parent who drove from Southfield everyday. Its worth the commute. I'm sad to leave but happy about the great educational foundation the school provided. This is a MUST see school, check it out.\",\n",

       "      'review': \"Giving Tree Montessori is a great school! I am so happy with the Montessori approach - the kids are guided with a firm & fair hand. Any concerns I had about Montessori being too unstructured were quickly erased after seeing the results. The teachers are very experienced and are fantastic with the kids. My daughter has spent 2 years at their pre-school and is about to start kindergarten. She can't wait to go back to school. She is starting to sound out words to read, she writes well, does basic math, is starting to speak Spanish and knows more than I do about several areas of science! All of this before she even starts kindergarten! The school is located at the intersection of Rivard & Mack bordering Grosse Pointe, but I wonder if some people don't realize it is in the Grosse Pointe area due to its Detroit address? Regardless, I consistently run into people who tell me their kids went to Giving Tree 5, 10, or 20 years ago and they all still have fantastic things to say about the school!\",\n",

I was most disappointed and eventually removed my children due to the willingness to retain students with struggles instead of exercising concern and assistance to dig to the root of the problem. If your child is ADD, ADHD or has any other learning disability or possible disability, I cannot recommend this school. I brought my concerns and suspicions to both teachers and principal and the best they could do was to insist upon retention if we returned to St. Clare. I ultimately decided not to. The fallout, my children lost their circles that were developing quite nicely. That is sad to say especially given my oldest was entering 7th grade. Yet this was the right decision my youngest, who St. Clare, wanted to retain. He is in his proper grade and doing much better. With the help of his new school he is receiving the testing and teacher collaboration that was needed to help him be a successful student.',\n",

Perhaps those giving perfect reviews are the parents deeply involved in the school through family history of attending or volunteering. Anyway, the school is mostly white. Diversity is sports scholarships for Detroit kids. In all fairness Grosse Pointe is not culturally or ethnically diverse therefore 98% of kids are white. Most teachers are good & caring. Discipline policy for kids is basically the more influence your parents have at school the more likely you will not be held accountable. Pressure to donate money but that is common at private schools. Headmaster is aloof. He only says hello to rich families and walks past & ignores others like they don't exist. Recognition awards seem to go to kids whose parents volunteer a lot at the school. Kids at school are very nice and friendly. Most parents are nice. Good school but it is not Cranbrook or DCDS or Roeper. My kids actually love the school but it is academically average. I send them there for the environment which is great for my kids bec it is small & community oriented. Many issues I have described here are common at all private schools.\",\n",

Not \"jealous\" as I did attend it for a semester... waste of time. three Merit Scholars left this year due to unsatisfactory academic experience. Elitist culture, cliquey, sports-centered, and extremely easy.I had a perfect GPA and didn\\'t even need to try. Too many kids are there to \"play sports\" and not to learn. No more honors classes leave the smart kids trapped with those who just want to have a good time and not learn. The administration told my family that I would be challenged, but man were they wrong. I was put in a lower level math class even though I am very smart, and they refused to move me up to the Honors track, even though I was awarded a Merit Scholarship and test extremely high. I definitely regret attending this school, and I am so happy that I left and am now attending GPN.',\n",

We have not found one student or group of students to welcome our children into this school. My kids hate it here and we will be moving asap! Parents..

Perhaps those giving perfect reviews are the parents deeply involved in the school through family history of attending or volunteering. Anyway, the school is mostly white. Diversity is sports scholarships for Detroit kids. In all fairness Grosse Pointe is not culturally or ethnically diverse therefore 98% of kids are white. Most teachers are good & caring. Discipline policy for kids is basically the more influence your parents have at school the more likely you will not be held accountable. Pressure to donate money but that is common at private schools. Headmaster is aloof. He only says hello to rich families and walks past & ignores others like they don't exist. Recognition awards seem to go to kids whose parents volunteer a lot at the school. Kids at school are very nice and friendly. Most parents are nice. Good school but it is not Cranbrook or DCDS or Roeper. My kids actually love the school but it is academically average. I send them there for the environment which is great for my kids bec it is small & community oriented. Many issues I have described here are common at all private schools.\",\n",

I was put in a lower level math class even though I am very smart, and they refused to move me up to the Honors track, even though I was awarded a Merit Scholarship and test extremely high.

My son Michael Frontera was a student here in 1982 - 1985 and is 30 now and attends a sheltered workshop situation in our hometown of Greenwood, SC. I believe the wonderful start he got and the therapies he received at FEC was the KEY in his development into the wonderful sweet young man he is now. Dorothy Martin was the \"principal\" at that time. I am so happy this school continues to serve the community. Tuition was very low then and we parents did alot of fundraising to keep the school afloat. Glad you\\'re still floating!!!',\n",

Inasmuch as she did this, to vilify the school, the curriculum, and the staff is too much. As a former educator in the DPS, I fully understand and recognize the fact that there are problems in many schools, whether they are DPS schools or schools throughout this country. Dr. Cotton has exhibited the right attitude, the steadfastness to work for the betterment of all students that enter the doors of DSA.She is one person. She wore many hats, some of them were very \"Hard hats.\" I strongly suggest that instead of spewing hatefulness,, .rollup your sleeves, go to the school, volunteer, tutor ,, spend some time there.',\n",

Inasmuch as she did this, to vilify the school, the curriculum, and the staff is too much. As a former educator in the DPS, I fully understand and recognize the fact that there are problems in many schools, whether they are DPS schools or schools throughout this country. Dr. Cotton has exhibited the right attitude, the steadfastness to work for the betterment of all students that enter the doors of DSA.She is one person. She wore many hats, some of them were very \"Hard hats.\" I strongly suggest that instead of spewing hatefulness,, .rollup your sleeves, go to the school, volunteer, tutor ,, spend some time there.',\n",
